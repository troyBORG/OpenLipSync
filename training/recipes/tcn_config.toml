# OpenLipSync TCN Model Configuration
# All tunable parameters for the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
#
# TCN = Temporal Convolutional Network: a type of neural network designed for
# sequence modeling that can process audio/video over time while maintaining
# low latency (minimal delay between input and output)

[model]
# Model architecture - these parameters control the "shape" and capacity of your neural network
name = "tcn"

# Number of output classes (what the model predicts)
num_visemes = 15  # CRITICAL: Must match the number of unique visemes in phoneme_viseme_map
# More classes = more detailed lip sync, but harder to train


# Network depth and capacity
layers = 5  # Number of layers in the network
# More layers = model can learn more complex patterns, but:
# - Slower training/inference
# - Needs more data to avoid overfitting
# - Longer "memory" (receptive field)

channels = 128  # Width of each layer (number of features/neurons)
# More channels = model can represent more complex features, but:
# - Uses more memory and computation
# - May overfit on small datasets
# Common values: 32, 64, 128, 256

kernel_size = 3  # Size of convolutional filters
# Larger kernels = model sees more context at once

# Regularization - prevents overfitting (model memorizing training data)
dropout = 0.1  # Randomly "turn off" 10% of neurons during training
# Higher dropout = more regularization, but may hurt learning
# Typical range: 0.0-0.3

normalization = "weight_norm"  # How to normalize layer inputs
# Options: "weight_norm", "layer_norm", "batch_norm"
# Helps training stability and convergence


[audio]
# Audio processing parameters - how we convert raw audio into features the model can understand

# Sample rate = how many audio samples per second
sample_rate = 16000  # 16kHz is good for speech (phones use 8kHz, music uses 44kHz+)
# Lower sample rate = less detail but faster processing


hop_length_ms = 10  # How often we analyze the audio (10ms for 100fps)
window_length_ms = 25  # How much audio we look at each time (25ms window)
# Window > hop means overlapping analysis windows (good for smooth features)

# LOG-MEL SPECTROGRAM: Converts audio waveform into a 2D image-like representation
# Think of it as a "visual" representation of sound frequencies over time
n_mels = 80  # Number of frequency bands (80 is standard for speech)
# More bands = more frequency detail, but slower processing
# 64-100 is typical range

fmin = 50   # Lowest frequency we care about (Hz)
fmax = 8000 # Highest frequency we care about (Hz)
# Human speech is mostly 50Hz-8kHz, so we ignore everything else
# This focuses the model on speech-relevant frequencies

n_fft = 1024  # FFT size for frequency analysis
# Larger = better frequency resolution, smaller = better time resolution
# Should be power of 2 (512, 1024, 2048, etc.)

normalization = "per_utterance"  # Normalize each audio file separately
# Helps with volume differences between recordings
# Options: "per_utterance", "global", "none"

[training]
# Training parameters - how the model learns from data

# BATCH SIZE: How many audio clips to process together
batch_size = 32
# Larger batches = more stable gradients, but need more GPU memory
# Smaller batches = noisier but sometimes better generalization
# Common values: 16, 32, 64 (powers of 2 work best)

# Audio chunking - long audio files are split into smaller pieces
max_chunk_length_s = 8.0  # Maximum 8 seconds per training chunk
min_chunk_length_s = 2.0  # Minimum 2 seconds per training chunk
# Shorter chunks = faster training, but less context
# Longer chunks = more context, but slower and more memory

mixed_precision = true  # Use 16-bit instead of 32-bit numbers
# This speeds up training and saves memory with minimal accuracy loss
# Modern GPUs (RTX 20xx+) support this well

# LOSS FUNCTION: How we measure prediction errors
loss_type = "cross_entropy"  # "cross_entropy" for single- OR multi-label (uses BCE if multi_label=true)
# Options: "cross_entropy" (standard or multi-label via BCE), "focal_loss" (for imbalanced data)
multi_label = true            # Enable multi-label training (sigmoid + BCE); targets become multi-hot per frame
target_crossfade_ms = 30      # Soft multi-hot targets around boundaries (0 disables). Use ~20–60ms

class_weighting = true  # Give more importance to rare visemes
# Some mouth shapes are much rarer than others in speech
# This prevents the model from ignoring rare but important visemes

# Focal loss parameters (only used if loss_type = "focal_loss")
focal_loss_alpha = 1.0  # Class balancing factor
focal_loss_gamma = 2.0  # Focus on hard examples
# Focal loss helps when some classes are much rarer than others

# OPTIMIZER: The algorithm that updates model weights
optimizer = "adamw"  # AdamW is a good default for many problems
learning_rate = 3e-4  # How big steps to take when learning (0.0003)
# Too high = unstable training, too low = very slow learning
# 3e-4 is a good starting point for most models

betas = [0.9, 0.98]  # Momentum parameters for AdamW
# Controls how much to use previous gradients vs current gradient
# [0.9, 0.999] is standard, [0.9, 0.98] sometimes better for transformers

weight_decay = 1e-2  # L2 regularization strength (0.01)
# Prevents weights from getting too large (helps avoid overfitting)
# Higher values = more regularization

# LEARNING RATE SCHEDULER: Changes learning rate during training
scheduler = "onecycle"  # Gradually increase then decrease learning rate
# Options: "onecycle" (fast), "cosine" (smooth), "constant" (no change)
warmup_ratio = 0.05  # Gradually increase LR for first 5% of training
# Warmup helps training stability at the beginning

max_epochs = 100  # Maximum number of times to see the full dataset
# Training will stop early if performance stops improving

# EARLY STOPPING: Stop training when performance plateaus
early_stopping_patience = 15  # Stop if no improvement for 15 epochs
early_stopping_metric = "val_loss"  # What metric to watch
# Options: "val_loss" (validation loss), "val_f1" (F1 score)
# Prevents overfitting and saves time

# DATA AUGMENTATION: Slightly modify training data to improve generalization
specaugment_enabled = true  # Randomly mask parts of the spectrogram
specaugment_time_mask_max_ms = 20  # Max audio to mask
# This teaches the model to handle missing/corrupted audio segments

[data]

# train-clean-360: [~23GB] 360h of clean speech
# train-other-500: [~30GB] 500h of varied/noisy speech

#In special for 360 and 500 grab a coffee(or your favorite beverage) because it will take a while.


val_split = "dev-clean"    # Validation set (for monitoring training)
test_split = "test-clean"  # Test set (for final evaluation only)
# Never train on validation or test data!

# OPTIONAL DATA AUGMENTATION: Make training data more varied
augmentation_enabled = false  # Start with false, enable if overfitting
noise_snr_range = [10, 30]   # Add noise at 10-30 dB signal-to-noise ratio
gain_range = [0.8, 1.2]     # Randomly change volume by ±20%
# Augmentation helps the model work in noisy real-world conditions
# But can slow training, so start without it

# PHONEME TO VISEME MAPPING: How speech sounds map to mouth shapes
phoneme_viseme_map = "training/configs/viseme_map_en_us_arpa.json"
# This file defines which mouth shape to use for each speech sound
# Different languages/accents might need different mappings
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: The ORDER of visemes in this JSON file determines class indices!
# The model learns: 0=silence, 1=PP, 2=FF, 3=TH, 4=DD, 5=kk, 6=CH, 7=SS, 8=nn, 9=RR, 10=aa, 11=E, 12=ih, 13=oh, 14=ou
# 
# If you change the viseme order, you MUST retrain all models from scratch.
# If you add/remove visemes, update num_visemes above and retrain models.
# Always backup this file before making any changes!

[evaluation]
# Evaluation metrics - how we measure if the model is working well

# What metrics to calculate during training/testing

viseme_crossfade_enabled = true  # If true, apply cross-fade during post-processing/visualization
viseme_crossfade_ms = 30         # Cross-fade half-width in milliseconds (0 disables). Typical: 20–60ms

[logging]

# More frequent logging = better monitoring, but slower training
